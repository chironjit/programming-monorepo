# Go Gin Webapp with Solid JS Frontend Deployed on a Single Fly.io Instance

This is a demo webapp with a SolidJS frontend (utilising typescript and tailwindcss) and a Go backend that utilises the Gin framework. We will deploy this app to Fly.io io as a demonstration, so some of the code will actually be specific to fly.io.
